  <p> I am taking this course for a few reasons: i need units to graduated, and i wanted to take a formal course in web developement not just a crash course that previous professors have given me.
    this is not my first look at html but it is the first time i understand, thanks to the first few chapters we have covered.
    i am hoping to learn the intricacies of making web pages which as i have said before i have already learned much on.
