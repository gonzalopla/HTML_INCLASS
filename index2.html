  <p> I am taking this course for a few reasons: I need units to graduate, and I wanted to take a formal course in web developement not just a crash course that previous professors have given me.
    this is not my first look at html but it is the first time I understand, thanks to the first few chapters we have covered.
    I am hoping to learn the intricacies of making web pages which as I have said before I have already learned much on.
