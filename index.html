  <p> Hello everyone! My name is Gonzalo Plascencia and I'm a computer science major at CSUF.
    The fall 2020 semester will be my last and I hope to get my foot in the door, at any company related to computer science
     as soon as possible this semester too. My interests include (besides learning about computer science) video games,
      photography, camping/hiking(I usually hike when I go camping but dont always camp when I hike!) and enjoy sports like soccer and cycling.
      I hope to perhaps start or work for a company that mixes a few of my interests such as computational photography.
