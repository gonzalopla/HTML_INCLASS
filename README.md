# HTML_INCLASS
## Gonzalo Plascencia
This is the first assignment for my front end engineering class.
we must complete the following
## Create a website consisting of three html pages
1. Introduce yourself.Tell us a little about you and your interests.
2. Discuss why you’re in this course. Do you already have experience with web development, or is this your first time? What are you hoping to learn?
3. Share some interesting pictures. Tell us why you like them.
Link the pages together so that you can reach each page from each of the other pages.
Include each of the following HTML tags at appropriate places in your site: <head>, <body>, <title>, <p>, <main>, <nav>, <section>, <ul>, <ol>, <a>, <img>, and at least one of <header> or <footer>.
- Do not limit yourself to the tags listed above; you are free to use additional tags as appropriate.
- CSS styling is not required.
- Do not “hotlink” the images from someone else’s site; include them in your web site’s repository.
- Do not use images that you do not own, have not obtained permission to use, or were not published with a license that allows you to use them. (Hint: search the web for “free stock photos.”)
- These pages will be published to the public web. If you have privacy concerns, feel free to fabricate the identifying information on page (1).
Test your site in at least two different browsers to see if there are any differences in the way your HTML is rendered.
☐  Use a GitHub client (not dragging-and dropping into your web browser) to publish your site to GitHub Pages. Write the URL of the published site below (Hint: the URL should include .github.io):
- If you already have a GitHub account and a User site published to GitHub Pages, you may use a GitHub Project Page (see https://help.github.com/en/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages) or create a new GitHub account for use in this course.
☐  Validate your pages using the W3C Markup Validation Service at https://validator.w3.org/ and fix all errors and warnings. Re-publish your site if necessary.
